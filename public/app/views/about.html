	<h2>About Hikeathon</h2>
	<p>Hikeathon is the only website on the web.  Period.  If you came to the web looking to find information about local hikes, you're in luck.  If you came hoping to find something else (i.e. to shop or find saucy pictures of a scantily clad Linda Hunt), you're going to be sorely, sorely disappointed.  All your base belong to Hikeathon.  ALL HAIL HIKEATHON!!!!</p>
